Tourism also promotes knowledegeable facts and history about the specific places all over the world either its Amsterdam for the massive hollocast or its India for the diverse culture and traditions, we all have the place and the history related to the place. Many of us like to visit different and new places, its like a dream come true when we visit the place by own but the biggest problem is to plan the trip by own and finally excuting the plan on the horisions and the reality is, we find it very hard to make it happen but what if we have a proper solution like booking hotel, making visit list and all th stuff in a single app! seems very reliefing plus interesting.
\n So, presenting a multi tasking app which not only promotes tourism but also helps to discover new places which have the important significance in the history.
\n Set yourself free to visit and discover a new side of the world."
